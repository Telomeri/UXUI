A start of a LOFI model in FIGMA related to the site mentioned in the user study PDF found in this repository. I whipped up this in an afternoon, and main purpose is to get familiar with making LOFI models in Figma, and hopefully make this into a HIFI model. Obviously in real scenario this LOFI model would be evaluated by barbershop employees and small user study as mentioned in the PDF. The alternative design is an upgrade with better usability, but the file is not yet uploaded. Its possible that this design should have a back arrow built in, even if it is meant to be on a website. It would just feel better?
