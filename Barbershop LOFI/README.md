A start of a LOFI model in FIGMA related to the site mentioned in the user study PDF found in this repository. I whipped up this in an afternoon, and main purpose is to get familiar with making LOFI models in Figma, and make this into a HIFI model. Obviously in real scenario this LOFI model would be evaluated by barbershop employees and small user study as mentioned in the PDF. The alternative design is an option where select is its own button. The arrow is remnant of old design. I could upload the share link here, but its a public repo so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
