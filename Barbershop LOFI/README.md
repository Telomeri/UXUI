A start of a LOFI model in FIGMA related to the site mentioned in the user study PDF found in this repository. I whipped up this in an afternoon, and main purpose is to get familiar with making LOFI models in Figma, and hopefully make this into a HIFI model. Missing most of the UX improving buttons and labels.
