# UXUI
Projects and assignments related to HCI, UX and UI

Contains a few examples of the different exercises I have done while studying HCI. I have also done a few UI designs and re-designs for a company I have worked for, 
which I cannot share publically. Some of them are currently in commercial use, and have mostly been standalone features in larger programs. For the code on the saliency 
article, refer to /Python/WebsitePaletteOptimizer. For a QT/C++ UI, refer to the /C-programming repository, and the pdf found there.
